Interstellar Robot Walker
===============================
The movie Interstellar has got some seriously funky looking robots. You know, those simplistic, blocky hunks of metal with fantastic senses of humor? Anyway, when I saw the movie, I thought: there is no way these robots could actually move around in real life.

This project aims to simulate those bots with the goal of using reinforcement learning to teach them to walk. The reinforcement learning algorithm will come from another project of mine, [Reign.js](https://github.com/turbomaze/reign). It uses Cannon.js and Three.js for physics and rendering, respectively.
